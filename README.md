# Automated-Email-Sender

This project automates the process of sending personalized emails/ campaigns to automate research workflows and support teams with actionable data under budget constraints. I originally developed it to invite participants to surveys or interviews, as we depended on the CRM team for email invitations (which used Mailchimp or other third-party platforms). By implementing this solution, the ![FTI Group Research Team](https://img.shields.io/badge/FTI%20Group-Research%20Team-FF8C00)  that I led gained full control over scheduling, tracking sent messages, and logging responses‚Äîresulting in significant time savings and independence from paid messaging services. The script reads recipient details, personalizes email content, and ensures no duplicate sends.

Once messages are sent, the tool automatically updates Excel and subsequently transfers the data to SQL
, expanding the research database with a consolidated record of participant interactions. By providing comprehensive statistics on when recipients were contacted and if/how they responded, the team can measure the success of recruitment efforts and refine future outreach strategies.

## üî∏ Download the excel file I prepared for you: 
[Excel_DataSource](./email_sender_datasource.xlsx)

- Open and review the Excel file (which has two sheets: "Customer Data" and "Sent Emails Data").
- Go to the "Customer Data" sheet.
- Fill in the columns: Email, Last Name, First Name, Gender.
- The script will automatically update the "Status" column to "Sent" after sending emails, don't fill in the column "Sent".
- Don't fill in the sheet "Sent Emails Data", the sheet will automatically update once your emails will be sent.
